      description: `Dear fellow community members!\n\n
  On behalf of the District of Munich, I hereby extend a warm welcome to you.\n\n
  Our district, the largest in Bavaria, is versatile in its nature, its business landscape, its culture and its people.\n\n
  Around 70,000 of the people living here have an immigration history. They are people who have found their way to us for private, family or professional reasons, some of whom have been driven from their homeland, people whom we have called as workers and, last but not least, people fleeing war. They have come to the District of Munich in search of a safe and good life. We owe our cultural diversity to all these people. We are happy about that! Because this diversity enriches our lives and makes us strong as a community.\n\n
  To make it easier for all of you to start with us, the District of Munich has compiled a variety of important information and interesting offers in the integration app Integreat.\n\n
  Integreat is a digital integration platform for people who come to a foreign culture through migration or flight and have to find their way locally. Integreat enables the easy flow of information between municipalities, aid organisations and a corresponding intercultural target group - whether in a municipality, a city or a county. Integreat provides important information in everyday life in a free, multilingual, offline usable app or on a website. Even for people without digital access, the information is printable and thus accessible through the PDF function.\n\n
  Our goal is for all people living here to be able to participate and contribute equally in order to help shape our country.\n\n
  Because as diverse as we humans are, in the end we are united by the need for belonging and connection, and for a country that enables us to achieve our goals, get involved and help shape our future.\n\n
  In this spirit, I wish you a good start in the District of Munich!\n\n
  Christoph Göbel\n
  District Administrator\n\n
